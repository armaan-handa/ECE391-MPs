# ECE391-MPs
programming assignments for class on computer systems. MP1 is assembly code to run a game based on the game of life. MP2 is C code to interact with VGA and support a TUX controller. MP3 is an linux based operating system with support for 3 terminals and 6 programs with a round robin scheduler, interrupts, keyboard, and system calls.

If you are thinking of using this as a reference be very careful. There is a fine line between referencing and cheating.

THERE IS A PLAGIARISM CHECKER!!!
